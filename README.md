# Max posts per usergroup

Specify a maximum number of posts per user group. If this number of posts has been reached or exceeded by a user of the group, the user can be blocked for new posts or new threads/ topics. It can be set whether the user:

- ... for new posts in non-self created threads is blocked
- ... is locked for new posts in own threads
- ... lock for new topics (the user can't create new threads anymore)

# Settings
These settings can be combined with each other. The plugin can be activated for different forums or for all forums!

Example:
- User A is in the following primary group: "Registered".
- A maximum of 15 posts has been set for the group.
- User A has now posted 15 posts. Then the settings in the plugin take effect.
- For example, the user can no longer reply to non-self created topics,, but can still create his own threads or reply to his own topics. It can also be set, however, that the user can no longer reply to own topics or may not create new topics.
